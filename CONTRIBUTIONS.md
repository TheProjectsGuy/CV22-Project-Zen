## Workflow

**Code** workflow for developers

- Create your dev branch from `dev` and name it after yourself. Example: `dev-adam`.
- Check work distribution in [TODO.md](./TODO.md). As you complete tasks, merge commits to the `dev` branch.
- Once many tasks are completed and a goal is reached, all developers must test `dev` and merge into `main` (if successful).
    - This merge is suggested to be a _single_ commit either through a PR or through `git merge --squash` (to maintain a clean `main` branch).

> **Note**: _Reading material_ can be added directly to the dev branch. Developers can branch out again to sync.

## Conflicts

All conflicts should be resolved by the person making the merge. Discuss with other contributors before completing the merge.

## Reading Material

Please give original links (DOI or equivalent) when adding reading material to the repository.

## Task-list

In the [TODO.md](./TODO.md), you're free to organize your header as you like. Make sure you **do not** erase the contents of others when merging.

Thanks! :tada:
